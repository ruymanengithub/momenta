I'm going to design an upgrade of moments.py in order to allow to create
.pdf files with relevant images for every target, using "LaTeX".

uses:  pyfits, fitscut, PIL, pylab, LaTeX


Things to show:

stamp, mask, skyimage

Radial profile

Petrosian ellipse on stamp

cross on Peak Center

Gini plot (+Gini Value)

Asymmetry image (+Asymmetry value)

Concent -> show both apertures on stamp (+Value)

Clumpy image (+Value)

Major Axis Asymmetry image (+ value)

Minor Axis Asymmetry image (+ value)

M20 : masks of pixels at both isophotal levels (+value)
